If anyone has a Wii U collection that would make a great addition. In addition to this me and a friend have been backing all this data up just in case it was taken down. So in that event PM me and I will find a way to get you the data.

Your going to want this program too https://www.7-zip.org/ use 32 or 64 bit depending on your version of OS, which you can check like this,

Windows: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64

Mac OS: https://www.macobserver.com/tips/how-to/mac-32-bit-64-bit/

I would recommend using a PC to download these files, because a phone while it can open 7zip files, is going to take ages to open some of these folders due to the number of files in them.

Also if you are download CIA files from 3dscia.com make sure to use this on them to use them with Citra.

https://gbatemp.net/threads/batch-cia-3ds-decryptor-a-simple-batch-file-to-decrypt-cia-3ds.512385/

Then you can convert them to .3ds without issues.
